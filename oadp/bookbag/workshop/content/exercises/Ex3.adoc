== Backing up multiple namespaces

We backed up a single namespace using the --include-namespaces flag from the Velero CLI. This flag actually accepts a stringArray, allowing us to backup multiple namespaces by separating them with a comma.

In the previous exercises, we restored two namespaces: nginx-example and mysql-persistent. Now, let's use those apps to perform a backup of multiple namespaces.
In our source OCP 4 cluster terminal, we can see the apps running.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n nginx-example
----

[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-56b7785cc7-g8xfj   1/1     Running   0          2h
nginx-deployment-56b7785cc7-q824n   1/1     Running   0          2h
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check that the todo list Application is still running.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n mysql-persistent
----
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-5f55cd786d-pshzl   1/1     Running     0          1h
todolist-1-deploy        0/1     Completed   0          1h
todolist-1-jx9xb         1/1     Running     0          1h
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s checkout the route to the applications user interfaces.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get route -n nginx-example
----
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get route -n mysql-persistent
----
NOTE: You can also use links here to open application routes http://my-nginx-nginx-example.{APPS_URL}[nginx-app] and http://todolist-route-mysql-persistent.{APPS_URL}[todolist-app].

Check that the routes are working correctly. Add a new activity to the todo-list app then proceed to the next section.

=== Using Velero to backup application namespaces

Let’s go ahead and create a backup of `nginx-example` and `mysql-persistent` namespaces.
[source,bash,role=execute-2]
----
velero backup create two-ns-backup --include-namespaces nginx-example,mysql-persistent
----

You can check on the backup progress by running the following.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero backup describe two-ns-backup && velero backup describe two-ns-backup | grep Phase:
----
When the backup `Phase:` is `Completed`, proceed to next section.

=== Viewing backup content in S3 storage
The backup content is stored in an S3 storage location specified by the content prefix. It is saved inside the 'backup' folder within the folder corresponding to the backup name.

`<bucket>/<velero-prefix>/backups/<backup-name>/<backup-content>`
Note: awsocs is an alias of `awsocs='aws --endpoint-url http://s3.openshift-storage.svc'`
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
awsocs s3 ls migstorage/velero/backups/two-ns-backup/
----

=== About Velero CSI Snapshots
The backup we did of the two namespaces used CSI snapshot capability of Velero to create snapshot on AWS EBS using its CSI Driver.

The details were explained in the previous exercise 6.0.

The namespace mysql-persistent that we backed up earlier contained a persistent volume claim with the storage class gp2-csi. As a result, the snapshot was created using the AWS EBS CSI Driver. However, nginx is a simple stateless app that does not have a PVC. In this case, we will not take any volume snapshots, and the cluster resources from the namespace nginx-example will be restored directly from the S3 bucket.

View persistent volume claim in the namespace `mysql-persistent`.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pvc -n mysql-persistent
----

NOTE: volumeSnapshot is immediately deleted after backup marks complete.

View VolumeSnapshot taken till the backup is `InProgress` stage.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get volumesnapshot -n mysql-persistent --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp -o name | tail -n 1
----

View VolumeSnapshotContent created.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get volumesnapshotcontent --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp -o name | tail -n 1
----

This storage class has provisioner `ebs.csi.aws.com`
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get storageclass gp2-csi
----

which is one of the CSI driver installed on the system
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get csidrivers
----

A CSI Snapshot is local to the cluster. In the future, a DataMover capability will be added to allow for the movement of snapshots to an external location.

=== Simulate a disaster
When the backup `Phase:` is `Completed`., we'll proceed to simulate a disaster by deleting the two namespaces.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc delete ns mysql-persistent nginx-example
----

Check that the applications are no longer available.

NOTE: You can also use links here to open application routes http://my-nginx-nginx-example.{APPS_URL}[nginx-app] and http://todolist-route-mysql-persistent.{APPS_URL}[todolist-app].

When application is no longer available, proceed to next section.

=== Restoring deleted application
We can restore the applications that were previously deleted using the backup we created.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero restore create two-ns-restore --from-backup two-ns-backup
----

We can check when the restore is completed by running the following. The restore is complete when `Phase:` is `Completed`.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero restore describe two-ns-restore && velero restore describe two-ns-restore | grep Phase:
----

Wait until pods become available.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n mysql-persistent
----
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n nginx-example
----

Verify that the data you added earlier persisted in the restored application.

NOTE: You can also use links here to open application routes http://my-nginx-nginx-example.{APPS_URL}[nginx-app] and http://todolist-route-mysql-persistent.{APPS_URL}[todolist-app].

Before we move to the next exercise, let's clean the cluster by removing the resources created during the backup and restore process.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero delete backup --all && oc delete vsc --all
----

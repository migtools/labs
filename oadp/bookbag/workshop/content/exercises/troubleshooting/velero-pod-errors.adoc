== Velero pod errors
Pre-requisite: Exercise 1 completed

When a backup or restore is not completed successfully, inspect the backup/restore logs for errors. `velero <backup/restore> logs <backup/restore name> -n <operator namespace>

View backup logs from exercise 1.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero backup logs mssql-backup
----

If there are errors, you can use `grep` to help find the errors.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero backup logs mssql-backup | grep -i error
----
We don't expect any errors here so the result should be empty.

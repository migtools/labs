== CrashLoopBackOff
In some clusters it is possible to see oadp-operator pod not create successfully, with status CrashLoopBackOff. It is usually caused by the operator requiring more cpu and memory resources than the default values requested in the Operator's ClusterServiceVersion.

You can see the currently requested resources
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get $(oc get clusterserviceversion -n openshift-adp -l operators.coreos.com/oadp-operator.openshift-adp -oname) -n openshift-adp -ojsonpath={.spec.install.spec.deployments[0].spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources}
----

Bumping this value up will resolve most CrashLoopBackOff errors on installation.
You can edit ClusterServiceVersion by going to the http://console-openshift-console.%APPS_URL%/k8s/ns/openshift-adp/operators.coreos.com%7Ev1alpha1%7EClusterServiceVersion/[Installed Operators page] then editing the resources values in the YAML of OADP operators' ClusterServiceVersion or through `oc edit`.

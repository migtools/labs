== Overview
The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) is an Operator that helps you define and configure installation of https://velero.io/[Velero] and its required resources to run on OpenShift.

=== What problem is OADP attempting to solve?
OADP enables backup, restore, and disaster recovery of applications on an OpenShift cluster. Data that can be protected with OADP include k8s resource objects, persistent volumes, and internal images.
The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) is designed to protect Application Workloads on a single OpenShift cluster.

If you want to migrate data between clusters, please look into the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.8/html/migration_toolkit_for_containers[Migration Toolkit for Containers project (MTC)].

=== Architecture
image:slides/OADP Architecture/4.jpg[]

=== Requirements
- ObjectStorage - AWS, GCP, and Azure. Other S3 compatible providers are available as an option with OpenShift Data Foundation which includes multicloud gateway for multicloud portability.
  - Needed for backup and restore of kubernetes resourcces and internal images.
- `cluster-admin` role is required to use OADP. Non-admin usage is on the roadmap for future iterations.
  - Cluster admin is used to add custom resource definitions for OADP and Velero resources.


=== Working with Velero
You can use velero CLI to perform most of the operations. See available commands.
[source,bash,role=execute]

You can also configure velero via kubernetes object json/yaml files using `oc` or `kubectl`. Click below for Velero API types references.

- https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/api-types/restore/[Restore]
- https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/api-types/schedule/[Schedule]
- https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/api-types/backupstoragelocation/[BackupStorageLocation]
- https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/api-types/volumesnapshotlocation/[VolumeSnapshotLocation]

=== Velero Plugins
Velero supports the use of plugins to integrate with different storage systems, snapshot providers, and supporting backup and restore of additional types of resources.

For server installation, velero will require at least one plugin is either of the type object store or volume snapshotter, or a plugin that contains both. Exception to this is if you will not be configuring a backup storage location or a snapshot location at install time.

To install plugins to Velero server, you will specify in the fields below.
There are mainly two categories of Velero plugins that can be specified while Velero:

- `defaultVeleroPlugins`:

There are five types of default Velero plugins can be installed: 
`AWS`, `GCP`, `Azure` and `OpenShift`, and `CSI`. For installation, 
you need to specify them in the `oadp_v1alpha1_velero_cr.yaml` file 
during deployment.

```
 apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
 kind: Velero
 metadata:
   name: velero-sample
 spec:
   defaultVeleroPlugins:
   - azure
   - gcp
   - aws
   - openshift    
```
The above specification will install Velero with four of the default plugins.
   
- `customVeleroPlugins`:
For installation of custom Velero plugins, you need to specify the plugin 
`image` and plugin `name` in the `oadp_v1alpha1_velero_cr.yaml` file during 
deployment.

For instance, 
```
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: Velero
metadata:
    name: velero-sample
spec:
    defaultVeleroPlugins:
    - azure
    - gcp
    customVeleroPlugins:
    - name: custom-plugin-example
      image: quay.io/example-repo/custom-velero-plugin   
```
The above specification will install Velero with three plugins: 
`azure`, `gcp`, and `custom-plugin-example`.

=== Provided APIs
OADP allow several https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/api-types/[Velero API types] to be configured and defined within a single Custom Resource YAML.
The most up to date API reference for OADP is located on the https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator/blob/master/docs/API_ref.md[openshift/oadp-operator] repository

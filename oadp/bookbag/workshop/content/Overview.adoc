== Overview
The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) is an Operator that helps you define and configure installation of https://velero.io/[Velero] and its required resources to run on OpenShift.

=== What problem is OADP attempting to solve?
OADP enables backup, restore, and disaster recovery of applications on an OpenShift cluster. Data that can be protected with OADP include k8s resource objects, persistent volumes, and internal images.

If you want to migrate data between clusters, please look into the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.8/html/migration_toolkit_for_containers[Migration Toolkit for Containers project (MTC)].

=== Architecture
image:slides/OADP Architecture/4.jpg[]

=== Requirements
* ObjectStorage - AWS or any S3 compatible object storage eg minio, GCP, and Azure. Other S3 compatible providers are available as an option with OpenShift Data Foundation which includes multicloud gateway for multicloud portability.
** Needed for backup and restore of kubernetes resources and internal images.

* `cluster-admin` role is required to use OADP. Non-admin usage is on the roadmap for future iterations.
** Cluster admin is used to add custom resource definitions for OADP and Velero resources.

=== Working with Velero
You can use velero CLI to perform most of the operations. They can be downloaded from https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases/[Velero github page].
The velero CLI we have setup for you is an alias to a binary within the velero deployment on the cluster.

Inspect the alias:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
alias velero
----

See available commands:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero help
----

You can also configure velero via Kubernetes object json/yaml files using `oc` or `kubectl`. Click below for Velero API types references.

=== Velero Plugins
Velero supports the use of plugins to integrate with different storage systems, snapshot providers, and supporting backup and restore of additional types of resources.

For server installation, velero will require at least one object store plugin. Exception to this is if you will not be configuring a backup storage location.

There are mainly two categories of Velero plugins that can be specified while Velero:

- `defaultVeleroPlugins`
- `customVeleroPlugins`

There are several default OADP validated/provided Velero plugins that can be installed: 
`AWS`, `GCP`, `Azure`,`OpenShift`, `Kubevirt`,`CSI`, and `VSM`. For installation, 
you need to specify them in the `oadp_v1alpha1_dpa_cr.yaml` file 
during deployment.

```
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: dpa-sample
spec:
  configuration:
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - azure
      - gcp
      - aws
      - openshift
```
The above specification will install Velero with four of the default plugins.

- `customVeleroPlugins`:
For installation of custom Velero plugins, you need to specify the plugin
`image` and plugin `name` in the `oadp_v1alpha1_dpa_cr.yaml` file during
deployment.

For instance,
```
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: dpa-sample
spec:
  configuration:
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - azure
      - openshift
      customPlugins:
      - name: custom-plugin-example
        image: quay.io/example-repo/custom-velero-plugin
```
The above specification will install Velero with three plugins:
`azure`, `openshift`, and `custom-plugin-example`.

=== Provided APIs
OADP allows several https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/api-types/[Velero API types] to be configured and defined within a single Custom Resource YAML.
The most up to date API reference for OADP is located on the https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator/blob/master/docs/API_ref.md[openshift/oadp-operator] repository

=== Installing OADP
OADP is available to be installed via OperatorHub, but we have already set it up for you in this lab.

DataProtectionApplication is a custom resource that is used to define the desired configuration which OADP Operator uses to deploy Velero, Restic and other components.

[source,bash,role=execute]

oc get dpa -n openshift-adp -o yaml

Note that the enabled supported plugins specified under `spec.configuration.velero.defaultPlugins` are

- openshift: Also known as openshift-velero-plugin, this plugin enables backup and restore of OpenShift resources such but not limited to DeploymentConfigs, ImageStreams, and BuildConfigs.
- aws: Also known as velero-plugin-for-aws, this plugin enables backup and restore using AWS S3 or S3 other compatible providers as object storage and AWS EBS for snapshotting volumes.
- csi: Also known as velero-plugin-for-csi, this plugin enables backup and restore of CSI volumes using CSI drivers for snapshotting volumes.

Also note the feature flags specified under `spec.configuration.velero.featureFlags` are

- EnableCSI: a required flag to enable CSI support

The object storage we are using is an S3 compatible storage provided by OpenShift Storage with local endpoint at `http://s3.openshift-storage.svc/`. We are relying on the aws plugin to access this local endpoint specifying custom s3Url. The bucket name is `migstorage`, the prefix `velero` is the directory used to segregate the velero backup and restore from root of object storage.

The snapshot locations enabled for storing volume snapshots are aws ebs.

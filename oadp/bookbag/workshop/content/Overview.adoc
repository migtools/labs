The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) is an Operator that helps you define and configure installation of https://velero.io/[Velero] and its required resources to run on OpenShift.

=== Problem Overview
Provide application granular backups that covers cluster metadata and Application data
image:slides/OADP Solution Overview/9.jpg[problem overview]

OADP enables backup, restore, and disaster recovery of an OpenShift cluster. Data that can be protected with OADP include k8s resource objects, persistent volumes, and internal images.
The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) is designed to protect Application Workloads on the same OpenShift cluster.

If you want to migrate data between clusters, please look into the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.8/html/migration_toolkit_for_containers[Migration Toolkit for Containers project (MTC)].

=== Architecture
image:slides/OADP Architecture/4.jpg[]


=== Velero Plugins
/** BSL */

/** VSL */

/** Backup/RestorePlugins */

    /** OpenshiftPlugin */

=== Requirements
- ObjectStorage - AWS, GCP, and Azure. Other S3 compatible providers are available as an option with OpenShift Data Foundation which includes multicloud gateway for multicloud portability.
- `cluster-admin` role is required to use OADP. Non-admin usage is on the roadmap for future iterations.

=== Ways to use OADP
/** Velero CLI */

/** k8s api via oc/kubectl apply/create */

=== Provided APIs
OADP allow several https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/api-types/[Velero API types] to be configured and defined within a single Custom Resource YAML.
The most up to date API reference for OADP is located on the https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator/blob/master/docs/API_ref.md[openshift/oadp-operator] repository

We are providing a copy below for convenience.

== Introduction [WIP - BLOCKED]

Backup/Restore hooks provide a means for running custom code at points in the Backup/Restore to handle logic unique to a Backup/Restore.
This may include scenarios where custom quiesce logic is desired, manual data Backup/Restore of unsupported types is needed, or to handle application repair after it has been migrated to a new environment.

There are 2 phases where hooks can be run. `Pre-` and `Post-` backup or restore.
One hook may be run per phase for a maximum total of 2 hooks per backup or restore.

The phases where hooks may be run are:

 * *PreBackup*: Before backup task is performed.
 * *PostBackup*: After backup tasks are complete.
 * *PreRestore*: Before restore tasks are performed.
 * *PostRestore*: After restore tasks are complete.

=== Backing up single namespace with pre and post backup hook

We are going to add pre and post backup hooks to the previous single namespace backup exercise.

In our source OCP 4 cluster terminal, we can see the app running:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n mssql-persistent -l app=mssql
----

[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mssql-deployment-1-dbxd7   1/1     Running   0          41m
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==== Adding pre and post backup hook

Let's add a simple pre and post backup hooks to pod
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc annotate pod -n mssql-persistent -l app=mssql \
pre.hook.backup.velero.io/command='["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo \"pre\" > /var/opt/mssql/data/lab-pre-backup"]' \
post.hook.backup.velero.io/command='["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo \"post\" > /var/opt/mssql/data/lab-post-backup"]'
----

Check that file pre-backup and post-backup did not exist in pod container
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc -n mssql-persistent rsh deploymentconfig/mssql-deployment ls /var/opt/mssql/data/lab-pre-backup /var/opt/mssql/data/lab-post-backup
----

[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ls: cannot access '/var/opt/mssql/data/lab-pre-backup': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access '/var/opt/mssql/data/lab-post-backup': No such file or directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


==== Using Velero to backup application namespace

Letâ€™s go ahead and create a backup of `mssql-persistent` namespace.
[source,bash,role=execute-2]
----
velero backup create mssql-hooked-backup --include-namespaces mssql-persistent
----

You can check on the backup progress by running the following
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero backup describe mssql-hooked-backup
----

Check that file pre-backup and post-backup exist in the pod container
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc -n mssql-persistent rsh deploymentconfig/mssql-deployment ls /var/opt/mssql/data/lab-pre-backup /var/opt/mssql/data/lab-post-backup
----

[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/var/opt/mssql/data/lab-post-backup  /var/opt/mssql/data/lab-pre-backup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==== Simulate a disaster
When the backup `Phase:` is `Completed`, we'll proceed to simulate a disaster by deleting the namespace.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc delete ns mssql-persistent
----

Check that the application is no longer available.

NOTE: Click http://mssql-app-route-mssql-persistent.{APPS_URL}[here] to open the application.

When application is no longer available, proceed to next section.

==== Restoring deleted application
We can restore applications deleted earlier by restoring from the backup we created.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero restore create mssql-hooked-restore --from-backup mssql-hooked-backup
----

We can check when the restore is completed by running the following. The restore is complete when `Phase:` is `Completed`.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
velero restore describe mssql-hooked-restore
----

Wait until pods become available.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n mssql-persistent -l app=mssql
----

[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mssql-deployment-1-dbxd7   1/1     Running   0          41m
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check that only pre-backup file exist in the pod container
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc -n mssql-persistent rsh deploymentconfig/mssql-deployment ls /var/opt/mssql/data/lab-pre-backup /var/opt/mssql/data/lab-post-backup
----

[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
post-backup  pre-backup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*Success!*  
In the next lab, we will explore some debugging techniques for when backups/restores don't go quite as planned.
